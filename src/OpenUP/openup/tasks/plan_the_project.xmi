  <mainDescription>Developing the project plan provides an opportunity for the team to agree on project scope, objectives, initial timeframe,&#xD;
&#xD;
and deliverables. It allows the team to begin demonstrating self-organization by defining success criteria and work&#xD;
&#xD;
practices to be used. Collaboration and consensus by all key project participants is the goal, but the project manager has&#xD;
&#xD;
ultimate responsibility for ensuring that everybody is committed to the plan.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Project planning, even at the summary level, should not be done in isolation since it outlines what the project will&#xD;
deliver and how. The team starts by discussing who plays which roles and agrees on their responsibilities. The project&#xD;
manager needs to make sure that staffing is made in accordance with the project's interests and that every necessary role&#xD;
is covered.</sectionDescription>

    for discussing with the stakeholders priorities for what seems realistic to develop within the constraints of the&#xD;
    project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project is feature-driven, the team looks at how many people they would need to complete these work items, which&#xD;
    gives them a high level understanding of project duration, staffing profile, and scope.&amp;nbsp;If the project instead is&#xD;
    date-driven, the team assesses how much work can roughly be done in the time-frame given and using the available team.&#xD;
    Out-of-scope work can be considered in future releases.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team identifies project risks, performs a qualitative risk analysis to assess their order of magnitude, and updates&#xD;
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/risk_list.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Ckay8Cc_EduIsqH1Q6ZuqA&quot;>Artifact: Risk List&lt;/a>. The project manager facilitates the team decision about which&#xD;
    risks they should respond to, and which risks they should watch for.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Responses may include avoiding or mitigating risks, exploring opportunities or increasing the probability and positive&#xD;
    impacts of the risk. Depending on the case, work items may have to be added or removed from the Work Items List to make&#xD;
    sure that responses will be prioritized and handled by the team along with project work. As it is not feasible to plan&#xD;
    responses for all risks identified, the team can decide to accept some of them. Risks to watch will be communicated to&#xD;
    stakeholders and remain on the Risk List and actions will be determined only if they occur.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the iteration length and use it to assess target velocity (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation.html&quot; guid=&quot;_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w&quot;>Guideline: Agile&#xD;
    Estimation&lt;/a>). The number of items to be delivered in each iteration will be set by the velocity of the team and the&#xD;
    estimates for each item. The team uses the Work Items List to outline what features to implement in what iteration,&#xD;
    putting top priority work items first, including planned responses to the higher risks or opportunities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenUP organizes iterations into a set of phases. Each phase in the project lifecycle will end with a milestone aimed&#xD;
    at providing stakeholders with&amp;nbsp;oversight and steering mechanisms to control project funding, scope, risk exposure,&#xD;
    value provided, and other aspects of the process (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle.html&quot; guid=&quot;_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA&quot;>Concept: Project&#xD;
    Lifecycle&lt;/a>)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You don't need to spend too much time in doing this planning. The Project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp; project milestones&amp;nbsp;and 1-3 objectives for each iteration. Do not commit individual work items to&#xD;
    the plan, since this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a high-level plan outlining&#xD;
    how&amp;nbsp;the team&amp;nbsp;can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations. Extra level of detail will&#xD;
    be achieved in other planning sessions throughout the project (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/tasks/plan_iteration.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0keUEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Task: Plan Iteration&lt;/a>). You may need&#xD;
    to revisit&amp;nbsp;this plan&amp;nbsp;later to adap it based on what you will learn&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;running&amp;nbsp;the iterations&#xD;
    (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan.html&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Develop a rough order of magnitude estimate for the costs of resources needed to complete project work items.&amp;nbsp; A&#xD;
    simplified project costing model&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;applied by&amp;nbsp;multiplying the approximate cost per person for the&#xD;
    entire team by the length of an iteration to derive ongoing financial impact (i.e., cost per iteration). This first&#xD;
    round of planning should keep things very rough and flexible. The goal is just to articulate value against the budget&#xD;
    constraints of the project and help stakeholders to decide whether it's worth moving forward with the project or not.&#xD;
    If necessary propose options to decrease costs, such as removing from the scope low value and high cost work items.&#xD;

with the operations and support departments to ensure that your project fits into your overall corporate deployment system.&#xD;

a cutover. You may also have to negotiate with the owners of the systems that the new system has dependencies on. Update&#xD;
