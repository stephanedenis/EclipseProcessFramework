  <mainDescription>&lt;h1> Identify architecturally significant design elements &lt;/h1>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;> Consider&amp;nbsp;each high-priority&amp;nbsp;scenario that is within &#xD;
  the scope of the project. Walk through the actions that the&amp;nbsp;scenario initiates, &#xD;
  and highlight the areas of the architecture that are factors in realizing, or &#xD;
  implementing, the requirements. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying components will help hide the complexity of the system and help you work at a higher level. Components need&#xD;
    to be internally cohesive and to provide external services through a limited interface. Component identification can&#xD;
    be&amp;nbsp;based on architectural layers, deployment choices, or key abstractions. Ask yourself these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is logically or functionally related (same use case or service, for example)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> What entities provide services to multiple other services? &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities depend on each other? Strongly or weakly?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities should you be able to exchange independently from others?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will run on the same processor or network node?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What parts are constrained by similar performance requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each component includes entities from the problem domain, control classes that coordinate complex tasks within&#xD;
    components, and interfaces that handle communication with the environment. The interface for each instantiated element&#xD;
    is identified. At this point, interfaces do not need to be as detailed as a signature, but they do need to document&#xD;
    what the elements need, what they can use, and what they can depend on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identified patterns define the types of elements, but not a specific number. Apply the chosen patterns to define a new&#xD;
    set of elements that conform to the patterns. Functionality will be allocated to the instantiated elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h1> Refine&amp;nbsp;the Architectural Mechanisms &lt;/h1>&#xD;
&lt;p> Consider each high-priority quality scenario, and map each of these onto the &#xD;
  Architectural Mechanisms. Refine the mechanisms to identify the specific technology&amp;nbsp;that &#xD;
  will handle each mechanism within the scope. For example, for the Persistence &#xD;
  mechanism, it may be appropriate to&amp;nbsp;use a relational database management &#xD;
  system, such as MySQL.&amp;nbsp;Consider the selection of technology in the context &#xD;
  of the requirements and constraints. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html&quot; guid=&quot;_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA&quot;>Concept: Architectural Mechanism&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h2 align=&quot;left&quot;> Map the software to the hardware &lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;> Produce a precise map of deployable software components to network &#xD;
  nodes. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h2> Define development and test architectures &lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;p> The configuration of the environments where the system is developed and tested &#xD;
  may be different from the target production environment, and this may have an &#xD;
  impact on the solution. For example:&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Additional software may needed to be developed to support testing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Alternative deployment configurations may need to be defined for different environments in response to constraints&#xD;
        on development and test&amp;nbsp;hardware.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Multiple environments may be required to support different categories of tests (such as&amp;nbsp;performance testing or&#xD;
        user acceptance testing). These will need to be specified.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p> These scenarios, although not desirable, are often forced on the team through &#xD;
  various constraints. Consequently, the architecture for these different environments &#xD;
  will need to be specified&amp;nbsp;with particular attention paid to significant &#xD;
  differences. Be sure to consider the impact of any differences on the quality &#xD;
  of the overall target production architecture. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h2> Validate the architecture &lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;p> The surest way to validate the architecture is through software. The software &#xD;
  developed up to the end of the Elaboration phase is largely aiming to validate &#xD;
  the architecture (to the point where it can be baselined), thereby providing &#xD;
  some level of stability during the Construction phase. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p> It can also be useful to perform simple validation by walking through the &#xD;
  main design concepts and models, perhaps by using a whiteboard or through other &#xD;
  collaborative techniques. This can help refine thinking but will not act as &#xD;
  a substitute for building some software. &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h2> Communicate decisions &lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;p> You can document and communicate your decisions as many ways as you wish, &#xD;
  for example:&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Publication of&amp;nbsp;reference source code&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Publication of&amp;nbsp;reference models&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Publication of&amp;nbsp;software architecture documentation&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Formal&amp;nbsp;presentations of the material&lt;/li>&#xD;
    &#xD;
  &lt;li> Informal walkthroughs of the architecture&lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
