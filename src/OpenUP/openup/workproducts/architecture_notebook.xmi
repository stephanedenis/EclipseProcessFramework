  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact gives context and guidance for developers to construct the system. It's a critical artifact used to help&#xD;
    capture and make architectural decisions, and explain those decisions to developers. It can contain any information and&#xD;
    references that are appropriate in communicating how developers should build the system. It generally doesn't contain&#xD;
    design information, although it will likely reference architecturally significant design elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At a minimum, this artifact should:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List guidance, decisions, and constraints the developers must follow in building the system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Justify those guidelines, decisions and constraints&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/arch_mech_2932DFB6.html&quot; guid=&quot;_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA&quot;>Architectural Mechanism&lt;/a>s and where they should be applied.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team members who were not involved in those archtiectural decisions need to understand the reasoning behind&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;context of the architecture so they can best address the needs of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other recommended content is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        References to architecturally significant requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        References to architecturally significant design elements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Packaging instructions for subsystems and components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Layers and critical subsystems&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Critical system interfaces&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Key abstractions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Important analysis classes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Key scenarios that describe critical behavior of the system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architects should use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture, and to help&#xD;
    team members understand the motivations behind architectural decisions so those decisions can be robustly implemented.&#xD;
    For example, the architect may place constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between different parts of&#xD;
    the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can explain that there&#xD;
    is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the system must adapt to&#xD;
    this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the Project Manager and other team members how the system is partitioned or organized&#xD;
    so the team can adapt itself to the needs of the system. It also gives whoever must maintain and change the&#xD;
    architecture later their first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is distinct from the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/executable_architecture_D4E68CBD.html&quot; guid=&quot;_O1kAANvfEduv2KOT-Teh6w&quot;>Executable Architecture&lt;/a>. This artifact describes how the system should be&#xD;
    constructed, while the Executable Architecture is a build that contains part of the validated architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To describe the context and perspective of the system to assure its integrity and understandability.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture can be represented in many forms and from many viewpoints, depending on the needs of the project and&#xD;
    the preferences of the project team. It need not be a formal document. The essence of the architecture can often be&#xD;
    communicated through a series of simple diagrams on a whiteboard; or as a list of decisions. Choose the medium that&#xD;
    best meets the needs of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture can be expressed as a simple metaphor or as a comparison to a predefined architectural style or set of&#xD;
    styles. It may be a precise set of models or documents that describe the various aspects of the system's key elements.&#xD;
    Expressing it as skeletal build is another option - although this build may need to be baselined and preserved to&#xD;
    ensure that the essence of the system can be understood as the system grows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Part of the architecture&amp;nbsp;frequently references architecturally significant portions of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/design_D677D182.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WuL8slgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Design&lt;/a>. It can reference models that describe &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/architectural_view_FF6EDA37.html&quot; guid=&quot;_T9nygClEEduLGM8dfVsrKg&quot;>Architectural View&lt;/a>s for communicating the architecture. A view is a representation&#xD;
    of a system from the perspective of a related set of concerns.&amp;nbsp;To choose the appropriate set of&#xD;
    views,&amp;nbsp;identify the Stakeholders who depend on software architecture documentation and the information that they&#xD;
    need.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
