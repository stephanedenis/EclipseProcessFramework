  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Glossary helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the Glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with Stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some projects that do not involve business or domain modeling, the Glossary is the primary artifact for capturing&#xD;
    information about the project's business domain.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although listed as an output from, and an input to tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this artifact can&#xD;
    be updated at any time, by any role, as new terms are identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>The goal is for the Glossary to provide a common vocabulary agreed upon by all Stakeholders. It can help people from&#xD;
different functional groups reach a mutual understanding of the system. The goal is not to record all possible terms, but&#xD;
only those that are unclear, ambiguous, or require elaboration.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Misunderstandings about the meanings of data items account for many failed projects. Some of them become obvious only in&#xD;
the late stages of system testing and can b extremely expensive to correct.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a simple alphabetized listing of domain terms and their definitions. It can be captured in a spreadsheet,&#xD;
    document, or published on a Wiki site to simplify access and maintenance.&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
