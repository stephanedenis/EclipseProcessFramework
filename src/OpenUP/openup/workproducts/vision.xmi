  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;provides a complete vision for the software system under development and supports the contract&#xD;
    between the customer and the development organization. Every project needs a source for capturing all Stakeholders'&#xD;
    expectations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;is written from the customers' perspective, focusing on the essential features of the system and&#xD;
    acceptable levels of quality. The artifact should include a description of what &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/termdefinitions/feature_4ED64AEE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_PgYREAeYEduWycDgioo5rg&quot;>features&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;will be included, as well as those considered but not included.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;provides a high-level, sometimes contractual, basis for the more detailed technical requirements&#xD;
    that are visible to the Stakeholders. It captures the essence of the system by describing high-level requirements and&#xD;
    design constraints that give the reader an overview of the system from a behavioral requirements perspective. It serves&#xD;
    as input for the project-approval process, communicates the fundamental &quot;what and why&quot; for the project, and provides a&#xD;
    plan against which all future decisions should be validated.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>If this artifact is not used, there is a high risk that Stakeholders and the development &#xD;
team will have different expectations.&amp;nbsp;This could lead to cancellation of &#xD;
the project.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <representationOptions>Tailor this artifact as necessary for your project's needs. It is generally good &#xD;
practice to keep this artifact brief so you can release &#xD;
it to Stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make it easy for Stakeholders to &#xD;
read and understand. You can &#xD;
accomplish this by including only the most important Stakeholder requests &#xD;
and features and avoiding details of requirements. &#xD;
You can describe details in the other requirement &#xD;
artifacts.</representationOptions>
