  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate that the&#xD;
&#xD;
    current build of the system satisfies the requirements allocated to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    Throughout the iterations, your intent is to validate that the implemented requirements reflect a robust&#xD;
&#xD;
    architecture, and that the remaining requirements are consistently implemented on top of that architecture. As&#xD;
&#xD;
    developers implement the solution for the requirements in a given iteration, unit test the integrated source code.&#xD;
&#xD;
    Then, a &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/tester_9859B590.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>tester&lt;/a> conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that&#xD;
&#xD;
    the solution, which is continuously being integrated, satisfies the intent specified in the test cases. The tester&#xD;
&#xD;
    defines what techniques to use, what the data input is, and what &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_suite_D54EEBED.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aDz0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>test suites&lt;/a> to&#xD;
&#xD;
    create. As tests run, defects are identified and added to the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot; guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>work items list&lt;/a>, so&#xD;
&#xD;
    that they can be prioritized as part of the work that you will do during iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

  <usageNotes>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Testing must occur throughout the process and throughout each iteration. Testing is not a final inspection to be performed at the&#xD;
    end of the project. As requirements are implemented and integrated into a build, you should test them as soon as possible.&#xD;
