  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of this activity is to define a technical approach to the system that supports the project&#xD;
    requirements, within the constraints placed on the system and the development team. The architect should do the&#xD;
    following: &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work with the team to create an initial sketch of the technical approach to the proposed system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the technical decisions are adequately captured and communicated&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the team has enough information to understand the approach that your are taking&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.&#xD;
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should focus on proving the architecture with working software. If the solution is similar to a previously&#xD;
    produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it will probably be good enough to&#xD;
    reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases, it may be necessary to develop&#xD;
    one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The conclusion of this work should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and&#xD;
    to demonstrate its viability to the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to&#xD;
    refine and baseline the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    This activity is best carried out collaboratively by the team, with the architect acting as a focal point&#xD;
    for coordinating and facilitating the decisions.&#xD;

&#xD;
    The major effort occurs early in the project; thereafter, you should assess the system regularly to ensure that the&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    design is still on track with the architecture.&#xD;
