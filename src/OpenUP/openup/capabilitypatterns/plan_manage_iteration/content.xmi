  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues&#xD;
    early enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team&#xD;
    in reaching these goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/project_manager.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>project manager&lt;/a> and the team launch the iteration. The prioritization of work for a&#xD;
    given iteration takes place. The project manager, &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/roles/stakeholder.html&quot; guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>stakeholders&lt;/a>, and team members agree on&#xD;
    what is supposed to be developed during that iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Team members sign up for the work items they will develop in that iteration. Each team member breaks down the work&#xD;
    items into development tasks and estimates the effort. This provides a more accurate estimate of the amount of time&#xD;
    that will be spent, and of what can be realistically achieved, in a given iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the iteration runs, the team meets regularly to report status of work completed, the work to do next, and issues&#xD;
    blocking the progress. In some projects, this status checking occurs in daily meetings, which allows for a more precise&#xD;
    understanding of how the work in an iteration is progressing. As necessary, the team makes corrections to achieve what&#xD;
    was planned. The overall idea is that risks and issues are identified and managed throughout the iteration, and&#xD;
    everyone knows the project status in a timely manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During iteration assessments, the key success criterion is the demonstration that planned functionality has been&#xD;
    implemented. Lessons learned are captured in order to modify the project or improve the process. If the iteration end&#xD;
    coincides with the phase end, make sure the objectives for that phase have been met (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones.html&quot; guid=&quot;_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg&quot;>Concept: Phase&#xD;
    Milestones&lt;/a> for more information).&#xD;
