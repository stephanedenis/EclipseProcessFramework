    This activity refines the initial high-level architecture into working software. The objective is to produce&#xD;
    stable software that adequately addresses the technical risks in scope.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architect and developers work together to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refine the initial sketch of the architecture into concrete design elements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the architecture decisions are adequately captured and communicated&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the team has enough information to enable software to be developed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the requirements that were prioritized for the current iteration are adequately addressed in the software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In an iterative project, the team should not attempt to develop the architecture for the entire project in a&#xD;
    single pass. Rather, they should focus on meeting the requirements in scope for the current iteration, while making&#xD;
    decisions in the context of the wider project.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

&#xD;
    These activities are best carried out as a collaborative effort by the team, with the architect acting as a focal&#xD;
&#xD;
    point for coordinating and facilitating the decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
    The work is best done in several sessions, perhaps performed over a few days.&#xD;
