    related to a major &quot;area of concern&quot; within the overall project. Grouping tasks into disciplines is mainly an aid to&#xD;
    understanding the project from a traditional waterfall perspective. Although it is more common to perform tasks&#xD;
    concurrently across several disciplines (for example, certain requirements tasks are performed in close coordination&#xD;
    with analysis and design tasks), separating these tasks into distinct disciplines is simply an effective way to&#xD;
    organize content, which makes comprehension easier.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another reason that several tasks are all categorized by the same discipline is that they represent a part in achieving&#xD;
    a higher goal, or performing work tasks that are all related to each other. Every discipline defines standard ways of&#xD;
    doing the work it categorizes. Such standard ways are expressed by so-called &lt;b>reference workflows&lt;/b> described with&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html&quot; guid=&quot;_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA&quot;>capability pattern&lt;/a>s, which define how the tasks categorized by the discipline work&#xD;
    together (in the most generic way). These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching practitioners.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Like other workflows, a discipline's reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities, presented as either a&#xD;
    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The &quot;semi-ordered&quot; nature of&#xD;
    discipline workflows emphasizes that the discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling real work,&#xD;
    for they cannot depict the optionality of activities, or the iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have&#xD;
    value as a way for us to understand the process, by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.&#xD;
