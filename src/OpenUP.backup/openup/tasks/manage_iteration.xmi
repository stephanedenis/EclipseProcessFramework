  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing the team is part of executing the project. The project manager is responsible for improving the interaction&#xD;
    of team members and the trust among the team, incorporating team building into project activities and empowering the&#xD;
    team to make decisions. Management is done by objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager helps the team to meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints and monitoring the progress&#xD;
    and work remaining to completion. When the team is falling behind,&amp;nbsp;the project&amp;nbsp;manager&amp;nbsp;helps the team to&#xD;
    assess how it can reduce work and still meet the iteration goals. Stakeholders' needs must be continuously met and&#xD;
    their issues resolved throughout the iteration. The stakeholders may need to be involved in approving changes and&#xD;
    actions that affect them.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager needs to do the following:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        continuously monitor the project to ensure it is progressing appropriately&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        enable the team to react as soon as possible to any change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many alternative means may be used to track the status. Quick, daily meetings with the entire project team are useful&#xD;
    to understand what team members have accomplished since the&amp;nbsp;last meeting, and what they plan to accomplish before&#xD;
    the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/daily_meetings.html&quot; guid=&quot;_251UMCmREdyy6Oss2-0s1g&quot;>Guideline: Daily&#xD;
    Meetings&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another approach is the collection of basic metrics, ideally automatically generated from the tools at hand, or&#xD;
    manually assembled. &lt;span&#xD;

    charts are one of the most useful project progress metrics. They show how many work items where accomplished during&#xD;
    previous iterations (or days) and the remaining work. They can be used to track project releases and iterations&#xD;
    (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/guidances/reports/project_burndown.html&quot;&#xD;

    Burndown&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp;Communicating project status is as important as gathering it. Keep the information visible to&#xD;
    stakeholders and project team at all times.&lt;/span> The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the project manager's key responsibilities is to know about the project team's problems and issues. The manager&#xD;
    needs to focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting is usually a good way to monitor those&#xD;
    problems and issues.&amp;nbsp;A record of issues that have to be solved within the team may be kept in the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration&#xD;
    Plan&lt;/a>&lt;font color=&quot;#003399&quot;>.&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives and identify who needs to be involved in implementing&#xD;
    the solution. Then, define the corrective actions and implement them.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    Identify risks as soon as the project starts and continue identifying and managing risks throughout the project.

    <sectionDescription>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur, that prevents the team&amp;nbsp;from meeting the&#xD;
iteration objectives it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by the&#xD;
end of the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. The project manager should work with the team and&#xD;
stakeholders&amp;nbsp;to revise the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../openup/workproducts/iteration_plan_B46FED39.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0aQBEslgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a> and, as necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks postponing&#xD;
them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the iteration objectives still seem impossible to be met, the team might&#xD;
consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the iteration to a new objective.</sectionDescription>
