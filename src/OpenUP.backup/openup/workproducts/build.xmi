  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This working version of the system is the result of putting the implementation of the system through a build process&#xD;
    (typically an automated build script) that creates an executable version of the system, or one that runs. This&#xD;
    executable version of the system will typically have a number of supporting files that are also considered part of this&#xD;
    composite artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    In an iterative lifecycle, each build must evolve from the previous iteration's build, adding more functionality and&#xD;
&#xD;
    improving quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    The purpose of early builds that minimize or eliminate a risk or verify architectural decisions is to achieve&#xD;
&#xD;
    consistently stable builds in later iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>Deliver incremental value to the user and customer, and provide a testable artifact for verification.</purpose>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    There will always need to be an&amp;nbsp;operational version of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
&#xD;
    This work product is&amp;nbsp;almost always a composite product made up of numerous parts required to make the executable&#xD;
&#xD;
    system. Therefore a build is more than just executable files; it additionally includes such things as configuration&#xD;
&#xD;
    files, help files, and data repositories that will be put together resulting in the product that will be run by the&#xD;
&#xD;
    users. The specifics of those parts will vary by technology in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
