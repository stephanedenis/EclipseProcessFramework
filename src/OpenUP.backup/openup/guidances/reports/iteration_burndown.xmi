    The iteration burndown report is&amp;nbsp;the primary tool for understanding the status of the current iteration. It shows&#xD;
    the trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort&#xD;
    left for each of the Work Items to be addressed within the iteration and showing how the estimated effort is changing&#xD;
    over the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These factors affect the teamâ€™s assessment of how much work remains:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The developer responsible for a Work Item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the Work Item. This&#xD;
        should be expected, because we typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after we have done a&#xD;
        subset of the task.&amp;nbsp;It's common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the&#xD;
        iteration, especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to&#xD;
        continue changing as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can&#xD;
    include cutting the project scope by removing Work Items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated&#xD;
    with a Work Item, or finding better ways of approaching Work Items, such as having an expert team member help with&#xD;
    difficult Work Items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
