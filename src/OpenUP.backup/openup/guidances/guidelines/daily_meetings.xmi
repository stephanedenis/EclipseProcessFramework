    Practices&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Daily meetings are the heartbeat of the project. All team members are required to attend&amp;nbsp;it. The meetings are held&#xD;
    in the same place at the same time every work day and should&amp;nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, teams do&#xD;
    the meetings standing up to keep them short. Anyone who is directly involved&amp;nbsp;can also attend the meeting as an&#xD;
    observer, but care should be taken because too many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to be&#xD;
    uncomfortable in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have at most 10 people.&#xD;
&lt;/p>During the daily meeting, each team member updates their peers with answers to the following three questions &lt;a&#xD;
class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#SCH04&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>[SCH04]&lt;/a>: &#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What did I do yesterday?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will I do today?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is impeding my work?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These 3 questions have a specific purpose [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#SUT06&quot; guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>SUT06&lt;/a>]:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The first question tests the focus of the team - anything done that was not work planned for the iteration is&#xD;
        questioned.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Answering the second question revises project strategy on a daily basis by reorienting the team due to dependency&#xD;
        changes that were revealed by the previous question.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The third question will create issues that may result in new tasks in the work items list. The most important&#xD;
        effect of this question is to create a list of issues that are assigned to the team or to managers.&amp;nbsp;The team&#xD;
        should expect management to help eliminating bottlenecks.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily meetings. Experienced practitioners tend to&#xD;
    add an additional question for improving collaboration among team members: &quot;What have I learned or decided of relevance&#xD;
    to the team?&quot; [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#LAR03&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>LAR03&lt;/a>].&amp;nbsp;“What might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?” [&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#YIP&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>YIP&lt;/a>]. Other topics of discussion (&lt;i>e.g.&lt;/i>, design discussions, gossip, etc.)&#xD;
    should be deferred until after the meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Value&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For self-directed teams, the daily meeting is a mechanism to quickly inform the team about the state of the project and&#xD;
    people. It supports openness and allows resolution of dependencies and conflicts in real-time. It builds a team -&#xD;
    effective teams are built by regularly communicating, sharing commitments and helping each other. [&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.html#LAR03&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>LAR03&lt;/a>]&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    What a daily meeting is not&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The daily meeting is not a status update meeting in which the project manager is collecting information about who is&#xD;
    behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    Neither is it a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are registered and usually dealt&#xD;
    with by the relevant team members immediately afterwards. It is the project manager's responsibility to resolve them as&#xD;
    quickly as possible or to make sure that someone on the team does so.&#xD;
