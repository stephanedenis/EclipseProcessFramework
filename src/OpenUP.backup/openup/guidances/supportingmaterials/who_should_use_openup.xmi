    OpenUP is most useful for four primary groups of users:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software development practitioners (developers, project managers, analysts, and testers) working together as a&#xD;
        project team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software process engineers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Instructors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software development practitioners can find guidance on what is required of them in the roles defined by OpenUP. Each&#xD;
    role describes a set of activities and artifacts for which the role is responsible. Guidance is also given on how those&#xD;
    roles collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders will find guidance on what they may expect from the software development team, and how the software will&#xD;
    be created. OpenUP also describes the stakeholders' responsibilities, and states how they can best work with the&#xD;
    development team to obtain software that meets their needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software process engineers can use EPF Composer to extend and modify OpenUP. Modification may be as simple as altering&#xD;
    templates for work products, or as sophisticated as adding activities necessary for creating software in your specific&#xD;
    environment (such as audits for safety-critical systems). In addition to modifying method content, process engineers&#xD;
    can add, change, or remove process flows to add organization-specific capability patterns.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    OpenUP is appropriate for academic organizations also. As an open source process, it can serve as the basis for&#xD;
    software engineering courses and, when combined with the EPF Composer, courses in software process engineering.&lt;br />&#xD;
