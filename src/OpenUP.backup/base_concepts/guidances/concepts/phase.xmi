    What is a Phase?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While the entire purpose of a project is to produce a product, the specific goals of the team will vary substantially&#xD;
    throughout the project. In the beginning, there usually is considerable latitude in the requirements for the product.&#xD;
    It may not be clear whether the project is feasible or even if it is likely to be profitable. At that time, it is&#xD;
    critical to bring an answer to these questions, and of little to no value to start developing the product in&#xD;
    earnest.&amp;nbsp;Towards the end of the project, the product itself is usually complete, and issues of quality, delivery,&#xD;
    and completeness then take center stage. At different points in time, tasks are undertaken in new ways and work&#xD;
    products will have new content.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To coordinate the teamâ€™s efforts in a manner that takes these fundamental observations into account, the project&#xD;
    lifecycle should be divided into a sequence of phases. Each phase has a defined set of goals, its own iteration style&#xD;
    and customized &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/task.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>task&lt;/a>s and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product.html&quot; guid=&quot;_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA&quot;>work&#xD;
    product&lt;/a>s to address the unique needs of the project at that point in time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Iteration and Phases&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each phase is divided into iterations. An iteration is a complete development loop resulting in a build (internal or&#xD;
    external) of an executable system, usually a subset of the final product under development, which grows incrementally&#xD;
    from iteration to iteration to become the final product.&lt;br />&#xD;
