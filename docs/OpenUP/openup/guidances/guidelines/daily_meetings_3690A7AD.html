    Practices

<p>
    Daily meetings are the heartbeat of the project. All team members are required to attend&nbsp;it. The meetings are held
    in the same place at the same time every work day and should&nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, teams do
    the meetings standing up to keep them short. Anyone who is directly involved&nbsp;can also attend the meeting as an
    observer, but care should be taken because too many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to be
    uncomfortable in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have at most 10 people.
</p>During the daily meeting, each team member updates their peers with answers to the following three questions <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#SCH04" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[SCH04]</a>: 
<ol>
    <li>
        What did I do yesterday?
    </li>
    <li>
        What will I do today?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is impeding my work?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These 3 questions have a specific purpose [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#SUT06" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">SUT06</a>]:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first question tests the focus of the team - anything done that was not work planned for the iteration is
        questioned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answering the second question revises project strategy on a daily basis by reorienting the team due to dependency
        changes that were revealed by the previous question.
    </li>
    <li>
        The third question will create issues that may result in new tasks in the work items list. The most important
        effect of this question is to create a list of issues that are assigned to the team or to managers.&nbsp;The team
        should expect management to help eliminating bottlenecks.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily meetings. Experienced practitioners tend to
    add an additional question for improving collaboration among team members: "What have I learned or decided of relevance
    to the team?" [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#LAR03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>].&nbsp;“What might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?” [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#YIP" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">YIP</a>]. Other topics of discussion (<i>e.g.</i>, design discussions, gossip, etc.)
    should be deferred until after the meeting.
</p>
<h3>
    Value
</h3>
<p>
    For self-directed teams, the daily meeting is a mechanism to quickly inform the team about the state of the project and
    people. It supports openness and allows resolution of dependencies and conflicts in real-time. It builds a team -
    effective teams are built by regularly communicating, sharing commitments and helping each other. [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#LAR03" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>]<br />
    <br />
</p>
<h3>
    What a daily meeting is not
</h3>
<p>
    The daily meeting is not a status update meeting in which the project manager is collecting information about who is
    behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.<br />
    <br />
    Neither is it a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are registered and usually dealt
    with by the relevant team members immediately afterwards. It is the project manager's responsibility to resolve them as
    quickly as possible or to make sure that someone on the team does so.
