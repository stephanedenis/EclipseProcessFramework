<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><h1> Customization resources</h1>
<p> There are a number of use scenarios for OpenUP. The simplest&nbsp;is to use 
  the&nbsp;content available from the EPF project (either the available published 
  Web site or the one that you publish from the available library). You can find 
  those resources at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf">www.eclipse.org/epf</a>. 
</p>
<p> However, you may be&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;adding, removing, suppressing, or 
  modifying method and process elements to make OpenUP&nbsp;more&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;to 
  your teams' needs, while keeping it consistent and understandable. </p>
<p> The following sections introduce a few fundamental concepts about&nbsp;method 
  content and process, as well as&nbsp;descriptions of typical customization scenarios 
  and&nbsp;links to additional information on how to customize methods. </p>
<h2> Method organization </h2>
<p> You can use EPF Composer to write, configure, and publish method and process 
  content. EPF Composer organizes the content in a <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_library_6E08F9E5.html" guid="_1xELEMaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  library</a>. Each method library contains one or more <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_plugin_190B9F5E.html" guid="_D4TLgMaGEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  plug-ins</a>. Every plug-in consists of two major packages:&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/content_package_F5C69063.html" guid="_SAWgwMaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">content 
  packages</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/process_package_368B7463.html" guid="_MN1doMaHEduMlb2cQZNTYw">process 
  packages</a>. Content packages contain <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/content_element_DA3AD029.html" guid="_N8x34B_LEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">content 
  elements</a>, such as <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/role_37A0C602.html" guid="_yUefQNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">roles</a>, 
  <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html" guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tasks</a>, 
  <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html" guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work 
  products</a>, and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/guidance_549AC394.html" guid="_83ttAB_NEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">guidance</a>. 
  Process packages contain <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability 
  patterns</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery 
  processes</a>. </p>
<p> Method content and processes are organized in the EPF method library according 
  to how they build logical units for useful <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/method_configuration_C2B8FA8A.html" guid="__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method 
  configurations</a>. For example, all content belonging to one specific discipline, 
  such as requirements or development, can be found in one content package. Each 
  of these packages might be further divided into sub-packages for specific practices 
  in these disciplines. For example,&nbsp;under Development,&nbsp;you may want 
  to&nbsp;have a package that&nbsp;factors all of the specific information about 
  visual modeling. Thus, you can add or remove&nbsp;visual modeling&nbsp;specifics 
  from&nbsp;Development with just one simple mouse-click by selecting or deselecting 
  the right package. </p>
<p> For more information on method organization, see <b>EPF Composer Overview</b>, 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposerOverviewPart1.pdf" target="_blank">Part 
  1</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposerOverviewPart2.pdf" target="_blank">Part 
  2</a>. </p>
<h2> Customization scenarios </h2>
<p> The following sections describe&nbsp;several possible customization scenarios. 
  For step-by-step instructions, see the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/general/EPFComposer_OpenUP.zip" target="_blank">Customization 
  Scenarios</a> tutorial. </p>
<h3> Use existing plug-ins and packages to build your own process </h3>
<p> This is the most straight-forward customization scenario. Based on the content 
  provided by OpenUP, you can use EPF Composer to pick and choose the packages 
  with the content that you want to have published and made available to your 
  team. Removing a method package removes all references to the content of that 
  package from the published process. For example, you can simplify a process 
  to have it contain a minimal subset of its content by removing packages that 
  contain elements of work that you do not want to perform. You do this by creating 
  a new method configuration (or copying an existing one) into your method library. 
  You can select packages as appropriate without affecting the configuration provided. 
</p>
<h3> Add&nbsp;method content&nbsp;that your team needs</h3>
<p> Some teams may need to perform a different task that is not contemplated by 
  the out-of-the-box content. Maybe they need to perform an extra step in an existing 
  task, or they may need to add a new guideline for a given technique that they 
  are following. Eventually, they need a new template for a document (or may need 
  to add or remove sections in an existing template). </p>
<p> In such situations, the recommended approach is to create a separate plug-in 
  in your library.&nbsp;It is not a good practice&nbsp;to make changes in the 
  provided OpenUP plug-in (or any plug-in for which you do not have control), 
  because new versions of these plug-ins, when deployed, can override the changes 
  that you have made. </p>
<p> EPF Composer provides a series of mechanisms that allow you to indirectly 
  modify the content in an existing plug-in by using content variability. In your 
  plug-in, you can define an element that contributes, extends, or replaces an 
  element in the existing plug-in. For example, in your plug-in, you can define 
  a task that contributes a new step to an existing task in OpenUP. You can also 
  define a new artifact that replaces one in OpenUP, and this new artifact can 
  have a different name, structure, and associated template, for example. </p>
<p> When you create a new plug-in, it should depend on existing plug-ins to where 
  content will be contributed, extended or replaced. After you have created your 
  plug-in, you add&nbsp;it to a new configuration from which you can finally select 
  the packages with content that you want published. During publication, EPF Composer 
  will resolve the content variability that you defined by adding the new content 
  into the existing content where appropriate, replacing existing content with 
  the content you defined, and so on. </p>
<h3> Define a different development lifecycle </h3>
<p> Both method content and process are created independently from&nbsp;each other. 
  For example, you create tasks in the method content (and define their&nbsp;inputs, 
  outputs, and responsible roles), but you do not necessarily define the lifecycle 
  of your process, meaning the sequence in which the various tasks will be performed. 
  On the process side, you then define the lifecycle (such as phases, iterations, 
  activities, and tasks), as well as the precedence among these elements. </p>
<p> Some teams may find the method content appropriate without any further customization, 
  but they may want to work by following a different software development lifecycle. 
  Some teams may like the four development phases and iterations from OpenUP, 
  but some may want to develop iteratively, without being tied to the phase structure. 
</p>
<p> You can add, remove and replace elements in the work breakdown structure of 
  an existing process by applying variability. This is called<b> process contribution</b>, 
  which means that differential changes can be applied to an existing process. 
</p>
<p> As an alternative to tailoring an existing process, you can write a completely 
  new process that reuses activities from one or more existing processes. In cases 
  where you cannot find any reusable material at all, you can also create a completely 
  new process from scratch. In most cases, however, you will start developing 
  your own process by assembling reusable building blocks from method content, 
  as well as predefined process patterns&nbsp;called <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability 
  patterns</a>. The resulting assembled process is called a&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery 
  process</a>. </p>
<p> This newly created delivery process&nbsp;is part of a configuration that you 
  publish and make available to members of your team. </p>
<h3> Publish the process Web site </h3>
<p> Every customization scenario is finalized by publishing content in a Web site 
  format that can&nbsp;be accessed by practitioners in the project. EPF Composer 
  allows you to publish&nbsp;content based on a given configuration, which will 
  publish all of the content available from the&nbsp;method and process packages 
  selected in that configuration. Another option for publishing is to select only 
  the capability patterns or delivery process of interest. This will make available 
  only the content related to the process packages that you select.</p>
<p> For the published Web site look and feel, you can customize the views and 
  nodes in the directory (tree) browser by defining <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom 
  categories</a> that will be part of your configuration. </p></td>
