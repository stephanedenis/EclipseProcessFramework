    Personal contribution on an OpenUP project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. A micro-increment
    represents the outcome of a few hours to a few days of work for one, or typically a few people collaborating to reach
    the goals of the iteration. The concept of a micro-increment helps the individual team member to partition their work
    into small units that each delivers something of measurable value to the team. Micro-increments provide an extremely
    short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A micro-increment should be well defined, and you should be able to track daily progress of each micro-increment.
    Micro-increments are specified and tracked by a work item. Change sets represent the physical outcome in terms of the
    files are modified as a part of completing the work item. Let’s have a look at some sample micro-increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Identify Stakeholders.</em> Defining the Vision is a task that can drag on for weeks, so to ensure that you
        make and track daily progress, divide the task into small and well-defined micro-increments. Describing and getting
        buy-in on what Stakeholders to put into a Vision document is a meaningful result, and may take a few hours, or at
        most a few days, and thus represents a suitable micro-increment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Develop Solution Increment.</em> Defining, designing, implementing, and testing a use case or even a scenario
        can take weeks or longer. To ensure continuous progress, we seek to divide the work into smaller increments, each
        of which can be done in a couple of days. A more suitable micro-increment may be to only define, design, implement,
        and test a subflow of a use-case or step within a scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Agree on Technical Approach for Persistency.</em> Agreeing on your technical solution may take quite some time,
        so we need to narrow the task to something that can be defined and agreed to in a short time. One way to partition
        the work is according to the issues you need to resolve, such as persistency or reporting. This micro-increment
        will probably involve defining requirements, surveying available assets, prototyping, and documentating the
        decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Plan Iteration.</em> This micro-increment could include setting up a meeting for creating the iteration plan,
        doing some preparation for the meeting, such as reviewing candidate work items, coaching the team through the
        iteration planning meeting, and posting the iteration plan for easy access. The end result is something complete
        and measurable, a posted plan that has buy-in from the team.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your application evolves in micro-increments through simultaneous execution of a number of work items. By openly
    sharing progress on your micro-increments through daily team meetings and team collaboration tools, you achieve the
    transparency and insight into each other’s work required for effective teamwork. At the same time, you demonstrate
    continuous progress by evolving your application one micro-increment at the time.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides a set of activities. Each activity is captured as a set of tasks, steps within tasks, and guidance.
    Even thought micro-increments are not an explicit construct in the process, you will find descriptions of how to carry
    out a set of related micro-increments that are commonly found in projects within the activity. OpenUP does not provide
    a complete description of potential micro-increments, and each organization should consider adding their own ‘recipes’
    for commonly occurring micro-increments.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides a powerful learning tool and makes it easier to find relevant guidance by outlining when you are most
    likely to carry out various tasks. This is done through a visualization of the delivery process which provides a
    time-based organization of the tasks within the context of a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../openup/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle_203F87.html" guid="_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Project Lifecycle</a>. As an example, you are more likely to agree on a technical approach early in the project. This doesn’t
    mean you wouldn’t make technical decisions late in the project. A process is like a map, use it to understand the big
    picture and as a reference, but when reality and map don’t match, trust reality.
