    What is an iteration
</h1>
<p>
    An iteration is a set period of time within a project in which you produce a stable, executable version of the product,
    together with any other supporting documentation, install scripts, or similar artifacts necessary to use this release. The
    executable is demonstrable, allowing the team to demonstrate true progress to stakeholders, and get feedback on how they
    are doing so that they can improve their understanding of what needs to be done and how to do it. 
</p>
<p>	
	Each iteration
    builds upon the results of the previous iteration, and will produce a product increment one step closer to the final
    product. Iterations are timeboxed, meaning that the schedule for an iteration should be regarded as fixed, and the scope of
    the iteration's content actively managed to meet that schedule.
</p>
<p>
    At each iteration, artifacts are updated. It is said that this is a bit like "growing" software. Instead of developing
    artifacts one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.
</p>
<p>
    Iterative development is very disciplined: the iteration length is fixed, the objectives of iterations are carefully
    planned, the evaluation criteria are established when each iteration is planned, and the tasks and responsibilities of
    participants are well-defined. Additionally, objective measures of progress are captured. Some reworking takes place
    from one iteration to the next, but this too is done in a structured fashion.
</p>
<p>
    Each iteration should address the most critical risks, and implement the highest-priority Work Items. This ensures that
    each iteration adds maximum stakeholder value, and reduces uncertainty. Iterative development is typically combined
    with frequent or continuous integration: as unit-tested components become available, they are integrated, then a build
    is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the capability of the integrated software grows as the
    iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was planned. 
</p>
<p>	
	Regular builds, such as daily or more
    frequent builds, let you break down the integration and test issues and spread them across the development cycle. These
    issues have often been the downfall of large projects, because all of the problems were discovered at once during the single
    massive integration step, which occurred very late in the cycle, and where a single problem can halt the whole team.
</p>
<h1>
    What Problem Do Iterations Address?
</h1>
<p>
    Today’s software applications are too complex to allow you to sequentially define the requirements, come up with an
    architecture and design, perform an implementation, carry out testing, and get it all right. With waterfall development, you
    typically do not get meaningful feedback on what improvements can be made until it is so late in the project that it is
    too costly to make them. 
	</p>
<p>
	By contrast, dividing the project into a series of time-boxed iterations allows you to deliver
    capabilities that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of each iteration. This approach provides rapid and timely
    feedback loops, enabling issues to be addressed and improvements made at a lower cost, while budget and time still allow,
    and before the project has gone so far ahead that major rework is required.
</p>
<h1>
    Iteration Length
</h1>
<p>
    Iterations are typically 4 weeks long, although some teams will work with iterations as short as a week or as long as
    six weeks. For factors driving iteration length, see the following table. <br/>

<h1>
    Why Iterate?
</h1>
<p>
    The iterative approach has proven itself superior to the waterfall approach for a number of reasons. See <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../../openup/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_6CCF393.html#KRO05" guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[KRO05]</a> for more details:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You are more likely to build an application that addresses user needs, involve the customer in the development
        project, and implement and validate the capabilities deemed most essential in each iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration is not one “big bang” at the end of a project. Each iteration evolves executable code that is
        continuously integrated to enable rapid feedback and minimize later revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Risks are usually discovered or addressed during early iterations. Implement the most essential capabilities
        partially, and demonstrate them to key stakeholders to make sure that you are on the right track.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your ability to work effectively is fine-tuned. During early iterations, team members are walking through all
        lifecycle activities, which ensures that they have the tools, skills, organizational structure, and so on to work
        effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management has a way of making tactical changes to the product. Iterative development allows you to evolve partial
        implementations of the end product quickly, and use these for quick release of a reduced-scope product to counter a
        competitor's move.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse is facilitated. Discussions and reviews of the design in early iterations allow team members to spot
        potential opportunities for reuse, and then develop a mature common code for these opportunities in subsequent
        iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects can be found and corrected over several iterations. Flaws are detected in early iterations, rather than
        during a massive testing phase at the end. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Project personnel are better used. An iterative process encourages widening the scope of expertise of the team
        members, allowing them to play many roles, and thus enabling a project manager to make better use of the available
        staff and simultaneously remove problematic handoffs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Team members learn along the way. The project members have several opportunities within a development cycle to
        learn from their mistakes and improve their skills from one iteration to another.
    </li>
    <li>
        The development process itself is improved and refined along the way. The end of iteration assessment includes a
        retrospective where the team identifies what can be improved in the next iteration in both the organization and the
        process.
