<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><h1>Opportunities in the OpenUP community </h1>
<p>OpenUP is developed by the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) team. EPF is an 
  open source community that depends solely on the active participation of its 
  user community to produce process content and tools. There are a variety of 
  ways to participate in the development and deployment of OpenUP, depending on 
  your interest and skill level. </p>
<p> If all you want to do is ask a few questions to get started, sign up for the 
  EPF Newsgroup. If you want to participate in discussions and decisions about 
  the content and direction of OpenUP, sign up for the epf-dev mailing list. Use 
  Bugzilla to get your hands dirty by reporting bugs and enhancements, verifying 
  the correctness of method content, or submitting method content to address process 
  issues. Participate at the highest levels by joining OpenUP technical and committee 
  meetings. These meetings are where detailed process issues and product strategy 
  are discussed. </p>
<p>
    Everyone who downloads or uses OpenUP is encouraged to participate at some level. OpenUP is only as good as the quality
    of the participation of its contributors.
</p>
<h2> EPF newsgroup </h2>
<p> The EPF Newsgroup is the place to ask and answer questions about OpenUP, EPF 
  Composer, and other EPF processes. Most of the traffic involves how to use EPF 
  Composer and OpenUP. It’s monitored by the community, and you can access it 
  like you do any newsgroup. Everyone who uses OpenUP will benefit from the support 
  it offers and by receiving announcements about OpenUP. Sign up for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/community/community_index.php">newsgroup.</a> 
</p>
<h2> EPF-Dev mailing list </h2>
<p> The epf-dev mailing list is used by the OpenUP development community to communicate 
  and discuss development issues. Sign up for the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/epf-dev.">mailing 
  list</a> to participate in technical discussions and receive meeting announcements.</p>
<h2> Bugs, enhancements, and process content </h2>
<p> Bugzilla is the tool used to track changes and tasks for OpenUP. Bugzilla 
  is the Work Items List for the OpenUP project and contains the requirements, 
  enhancements, bugs, to-do items, and so forth for the project. Anyone in the 
  community is invited to report bugs and enhancements, to provide content addressing 
  the bugs and enhancements, and to help validate that the content is correct. 
  You can provide content simply by adding an attachment to any Bugzilla entry. 
</p>
<p> Learn how to use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/process/change_request_faq.php">Bugzilla 
  change requests</a> for OpenUP. </p>
<p> Content can be submitted as text files or exported from EPF Composer as plug-ins 
  or XML. Edit the latest version of the libraries by downloading them from the 
  CVS in EPF Composer. Set up EPF Composer to download the OpenUP library by following 
  the instructions on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/composer_dev_guide/cvs_setup.php">EPF 
  Composer Development Guide</a>. Note that only committers can commit changes 
  to the CVS. Any changes made by contributors must be attached to a Bugzilla 
  entry. </p>
<h2> Meetings and committees</h2>
<p> There are numerous meetings every week to discuss OpenUP progress and define 
  solutions. The <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/eclipseprocessframework/cal" title="EPF Calendar">EPF 
  Calendar</a> is open to everyone and lists all upcoming meetings (teleconferences 
  and face-to-face). Participate in these meetings to dive deeply into OpenUP 
  issues by collaborating directly with other members of the community. Although 
  everyone is welcome to attend these meetings, it’s generally expected that participants 
  will, at some point, take responsibility for some OpenUP tasks. </p>
<p> The calendar and epf-dev newsgroup also announce the EPF Committer meetings. 
  Currently, these are held quarterly in both the North America and Europe. This 
  is the highest level of participation, where committers and contributors make 
  critical decisions about EPF projects, including OpenUP. Everyone from the OpenUP 
  community is welcome, and attendees are expected to participate in discussions 
  and take on responsibility for addressing aspects of the EPF. </p></td>
