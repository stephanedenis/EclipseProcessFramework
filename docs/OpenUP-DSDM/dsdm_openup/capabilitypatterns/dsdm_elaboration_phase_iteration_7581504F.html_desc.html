    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Most activities during a typical iteration in Elaboration phase happen in parallel. Essentially, the main objectives
    for Elaboration are related to better understanding the requirements, creating and establishing a baseline for the
    architecture for the system, and mitigating top-priority risks.
</p>
<p>
    The activities performed in a typical iteration during&nbsp;the Elaboration phase are described below.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage iteration
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues
    early enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team
    in reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/project_manager_E657F936.html" guid="_0a0o0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">project manager</a> and the team launche the iteration, allocating work items to team
    members (some project teams will prefer to have members volunteer to perform work). The project manager collaborates
    with the team to break down the work items into development tasks to perform in that iteration. This provides a more
    accurate estimate of time to spend on what can be realistically achieved.
</p>
<p>
    As the iteration runs, the project manager performs monitoring and control of&nbsp;the project by regularly checking
    the status of work completed, the work to do next, and issues blocking the progress<strong>.</strong> In some projects,
    this checking occurs in daily meetings, which allows for a&nbsp;more precise&nbsp;understanding of how the work in an
    iteration is progressing. As needed, the&nbsp;team makes corrections to achieve what was planned. The overall idea is
    that risks and issues are identified and managed throughout the iteration. and everyone knows the project status.
</p>
<p>
    The prioritization of work for a given iteration takes place. Project manager,&nbsp;<a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html" guid="_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ">stakeholders</a>, and the remaining team members agree on what is supposed to be
    developed during that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    As in any other iteration assessment, demonstration of implemented functionality planned for that iteration is the key
    success criterion. During iteration assessments in Elaboration, though, keep the phase objectives in mind. As
    Elaboration iterations are performed, an executable architecture evolves, and you establish a baseline at the end of
    the phase. In addition, requirements are better understood and detailed. Essential risks, including the architectural
    ones, have been mitigated. These results&nbsp;help the project manager produce more accurate estimates for the project
    schedule and cost.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage requirements
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to understand and prioritize
    stakeholder needs and associated requirements for the system, and also to capture these in a form that supports
    effective communication and collaboration between the stakeholders and development team.
</p>
<p>
    During the Elaboration phase, requirements can still be captured and outlined as customer needs arise. The
    prioritization of requirements determines when new requirements are going to be implemented. High-risk, architecturally
    significant requirements are detailed to the extent necessary to be able to use that information as input to
    architecture and development activities in the current iteration, plus in planning for the next iteration.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/test_case_335C5DEA.html" guid="_0ZS-0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Test cases</a> describe which&nbsp;requirements are being tested&nbsp;in that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:<br />
    <br />
    </strong> The emphasis on finding, outlining and detailing requirements varies from phase to phase. Iterations in
    Inception and early Elaboration tend to focus more on identifying and outlining requirements in general and on
    detailing high-priority and architecturally significant requirements. During iterations in late Elaboration and early
    Construction, the remaining requirements are usually outlined and detailed.
</p>
<h4>
    Define the architecture
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated in each iteration in the Elaboration phase. The main&nbsp;goal of this activity is&nbsp;to
    propose an <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/architecture_notebook_9BB92433.html" guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">architecture</a> that addresses the requirements with high architectural risks, thus
    providing a solid, yet resilient, foundation on which to build the system functionality.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/roles/architect_E7A12309.html" guid="_0X9iEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">architect</a> analyzes the architectural constraints, identifies available assets to
    build the system, defines how the system will be structured, and identifies the initial abstractions and mechanisms
    that must be provided by the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout all of the iterations, the architect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identifies commonalities between different requirements to leverage reuse
    </li>
    <li>
        Defines strategies for achieving requirements related to quality
    </li>
    <li>
        Captures and communicates architectural decisions
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Develop solution for requirement within context
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is instantiated multiple times, in parallel, for each development task planned for that iteration. The
    main goal of this activity is an executable system that provides the incremental quality and functionality for the
    specified requirements within the specified context.
</p>
<p>
    As the requirements planned for the iteration are broken down into development tasks, these are assigned by the project
    managers to <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/developer_C633AB7.html" guid="_0YDosMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">developers</a> (some project teams prefer to have team members sign up for development
    tasks themselves).
</p>
<p>
    The solution to be developed is for a particular requirement within a context, which reflects the idea of breaking down
    requirements into development tasks. As an example, a particular use-case scenario within the context of database
    access could be assigned to a developer; whereas, the same scenario within the user interface and business logic
    contexts could be assigned to a different developer. In this example, more than one developer is working on a
    particular piece of functionality to be delivered in a particular iteration. As they develop the requirement within the
    context they were assigned to, they perform&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/developer_test_8470ED13.html" guid="_0YuXEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tests</a> and integrate their work to create <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/build_95D7D8FD.html" guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">builds</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Validate build
</h4>
<p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate the current
    increment of the system against the requirements allocated to it.
</p>
<p>
    The intent is to validate that the high-priority requirements implemented reflect a robust architecture so that
    remaining requirements can be implemented on top of that architecture. As developer develop the solution for the
    requirements in a given iteration, the integrated source code is unit-tested. Then, a separate <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/tester_9859B590.html" guid="_0ZM4MclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">tester</a> conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that
    the solution, which is continuously being integrated, matches what is specified in the requirements. Then, the tester
    defines what techniques to use, what the data input is, what <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/guidances/guidelines/test_suite_D54EEBED.html" guid="_0aDz0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">test suites</a> to create. As tests are performed, defects found are reported and added
    to the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html" guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">work items list</a>, so they can be prioritized and assigned to team members.
</p>
<h4>
    Ongoing tasks
</h4>
<p>
    This activity includes tasks that happen throughout the iteration on an ongoing basis but are not necessarily part of a
    plan. For example, at any time, <a class="elementlinkwithusertext" href="./../../openup/roles/any_role_C36B701F.html" guid="_0dsWoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">any role</a> in
    the project team can issue a <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../openup/guidances/concepts/change_requests_AD4868FE.html" guid="_6jdvECb3Edqh1LYUOGRh2A">change request</a>, either because there are requests for enhancements, or defects are
    found. These change requests are part of the work items list and are prioritized and assigned to team members. Anyone
    can be assigned to make changes that develop enhancements or fix defects.
