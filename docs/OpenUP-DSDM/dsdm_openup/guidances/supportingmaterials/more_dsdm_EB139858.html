<p>
    DSDM is a vendor-independent method that recognises that more projects fail because of people issues than technology.
    The focus is on helping people to work effectively together to achieve the business goals. DSDM is also tool and
    technique independent, enabling it to be used in any business and technical environment without tying the method users
    to any particular vendor.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM is published, maintained and continuously improved by the DSDM Consortium (<a href="http://www.dsdm.org/" target="_blank">www.dsdm.org</a>), a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the promotion of best practice for
    software development and Agile project management.
</p>
<p>
    A fundamental assumption of the DSDM approach is that <b>nothing is built perfectly first time</b>, but that 80% of the
    solution can be produced in 20% of the time that it would take to produce the total solution. A basic problem with less
    agile approaches is the expectation that potential system users can predict what all their requirements will be at some
    distant point in time. This problem is compounded by the fact that the mere existence of a new system affects the
    users' requirements because the methods of working have changed.
</p>
<p>
    In the classical, sequential (or "waterfall") approach, the next step cannot be started until the previous step is
    completed and fully tested. In practice, a lot of time is spent in getting from the 80% solution to the total solution,
    with the assumption that no step ever needs to be revisited. This means that considerable time is spent going back to
    "completed" steps and unravelling the defects from work that has previously been accepted. The result is that projects
    are delivered late and over budget or they fail to meet the business needs since time is not spent reworking the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    DSDM assumes that all previous steps can be revisited as part of its iterative approach. Therefore, <b>the current step
    need be completed only enough to move to the next step</b>, since it can be finished in a later iteration. The premise
    is that the business requirements are likely to change anyway as understanding increases, so any further work would
    have been wasted!
</p>
<p>
    <b>Systems built using the DSDM approach address the current and imminent needs of the business</b> rather than the
    traditional approach of attacking all the perceived possibilities. The resulting system is, therefore, expected to
    better fit to the true business needs, be easier to test and be more likely to be accepted into the users' working
    practices. Since the development cost of most applications is only a small part of the total lifecycle costs, it makes
    sense to build simpler systems that are fit for purpose and easier to maintain and modify after their initial
    development. The latter is possible since maintenance can be treated as a further incremental delivery towards the
    total solution.
