<p>
    Facilitated Workshops have been used in business and systems development in particular for years. Initially they were
    used for JRP (Joint Requirements Planning) and JAD (Joint Application Design) but their usefulness was quickly seen in
    other areas.
</p>
<p>
    They are a core technique in DSDM for speed and efficiency as a way of making high quality team-based decisions in
    short timescales.
</p>
<p>
    <span>&#160;Whether they are used for DSDM or any other business project, they are run in the same way. This section
    examines how the approach maps directly onto DSDM and where in DSDM they can be used. It seeks to show the potential of
    possible use of Facilitated Workshops in a DSDM project, rather than mandate their use at any particular point. It is
    up to the project members themselves to decide whether a workshop is necessary, or whether another technique, such as
    interviewing or research is more applicable.</span>
</p>
<p>
    Used properly, Facilitated Workshops are a useful tool for effecting cultural change in an organisation because they
    promote buy-in from and empowerment of participants. When used effectively, they can set the tone for the whole
    project.
</p>
<p>
    Note: It is not intended to explain here how to set up and run facilitated workshops but to show how the technique can
    be applied to DSDM projects.

</h3>
<h4>
    Definition
</h4>
<p>
    A facilitated workshop is a structured approach to ensure that a group of people can reach a predetermined objective in
    a compressed timeframe, supported by an impartial facilitator.
</p>
<h4>
    Benefits
</h4>
<p>
    Using Facilitated Workshops brings both direct and indirect benefits to a project.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rapid, quality decision-making.</strong> Because all stakeholders are present at the same time, there is
        great confidence in the result. The group is focused on the objectives to be achieved in the session so that the
        information gathering and review cycle is performed at a greater speed. Also, misunderstandings and disagreements
        can be worked out at the time. Any concerns should therefore have been raised and resolved or noted by the end of
        the workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Greater user buy-in.</strong> Workshops, run effectively, lead to participants feeling more involved in the
        project and decisions being made. They build and maintain enthusiasm.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Building team spirit.</strong>&#160;Facilitated workshops&#160;are a controlled way of building rapport as
        well as delivering the primary objectives of the workshop.&#160;They can promote understanding and co-operation
        between departments, which is particularly important when a development involves many groups.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process redesign by the user community</strong> If practices are reviewed as a result of a workshop,
        participants gain a greater understanding of the inputs and implications of their work. This leads to improved
        efficiencies that are&#160;driven by the participants themselves, giving greater buy-in and commitment and
        therefore a greater chance of successful implementation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Clarification of requirements when they are unclear</strong> Business users can be led through their
        objectives and processes to define what they may require. In the facilitated environment, participants can explore
        and model ideas. This is successful through a combination of structured discussion and the presence of
        knowledgeable participants.<br />
    </li>

<p>
    This section gives some guidance on which DSDM roles would fill the roles of a workshop. These are defined as being
    Workshop Owner, Facilitator, Participants, Scribe and Observer.<br />
    <br />
</p>
<h5>
    Workshop Owner
</h5>
<p>
    This is the owner of the problem that the workshop is set to solve. It is up to them to set the objectives and
    deliverables of the workshop, although these should also be agreed by the participants.
</p>
<p>
    The owner of a Feasibility Study workshop could well be the Executive Sponsor whereas the owner of a timebox planning
    session could be the Project Manager or Team Leader or even the Ambassador User.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Facilitator" name="Facilitator"></a>Facilitator
</h5>
<p>
    The Facilitator should be impartial, with no stake in the outcome of the workshop, and therefore should come from
    outside the project. The Facilitator maps directly onto the DSDM role.
</p>
<h5>
    Participant
</h5>
<p>
    Participants represent the views of the project stakeholders (e.g. the business and software development community).
    They are the individuals who are knowledgeable in the areas under consideration. They manage and operate the system and
    include managers, supervisors, clerical staff, and IT staff.
</p>
<p>
    A participant could be one of many roles within the business or IT side. They could be a business user, a customer, a
    supplier, a business analyst or data modeller or systems architect, a member of the financial staff, an auditor, or
    indeed any of the core DSDM or specialist roles.
</p>
<h5>
    Observer
</h5>
<p>
    Observers are not allowed to contribute towards the output of the workshop. If they need to take part at all, they
    should be Participants. Examples of the use of an Observer are therefore limited but could include someone auditing the
    workshop process or the facilitator's ability, or a trainee facilitator who would want to observe the group dynamics
    without being part of the group. Observers could also be development or support staff gathering useful background, but
    in these cases it should be checked whether they should really be contributing to the session.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Scribe" name="Scribe"></a>Scribe
</h5>
<p>
    The Scribe records what is happening within the workshop. The role could be held by a co-facilitator, a business
    analyst, developer or user so long as the individual has the required understanding of the issues in order to know what
    to record. There may be two Scribes in a workshop. For example, one of the Developers might use a CASE tool to directly
    model what's being discussed while another scribe takes down the discussion notes for later reference.
</p>
<h4>
    Applying the DSDM principles
</h4>
<p>
    Facilitated Workshops are like a DSDM project in miniature with defined deliverables in a tight timescale and empowered
    users. Early workshops can build the foundation for this approach to continue throughout the project. This list below
    shows how the DSDM Principles apply in Facilitated Workshops.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Active user involvement is imperative.</strong> Workshops provide an ideal format for the business to be
        directly involved in planning, designing and implementing a solution.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>DSDM teams must be empowered to make decisions.</strong> Workshop participants need to be empowered and
        have the right level of knowledge and authority within the scope of the workshop, so that decisions can be made
        without delay.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The focus is on frequent delivery of products.</strong> It is good practice to structure a workshop so that
        there are intermediate deliverables. It helps to order participants' thinking as they progress in logical steps.
        This enables them to work towards an ultimate goal and gives them a growing sense of achievement as the workshop
        progresses.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fitness for purpose is the essential criterion for acceptance of deliverables.</strong> The Facilitator
        checks that fitness for purpose is achieved by keeping participants focused on delivery against an agreed set of
        objectives. They ensure all are involved in decision-making.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Iterative and incremental prototyping is necessary to converge on an accurate business solution.</strong>
        One of the strengths of workshops is the synergy achieved by the group. Ideas do not have to be born fully
        developed but can grow during discussion. In effect, they are being prototyped. It is an ideal setting to try out
        ideas with all stakeholders and it is up to the facilitator to provide a safe environment in which this may
        happen.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>All changes during development are reversible.</strong> Information and decisions should be recorded as
        necessary by either one or both of the facilitator and scribe so that ideas can be backtracked where necessary.
        Often what happens in practice is that an idea or decision is redeveloped.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Requirements are baselined at a high level.</strong> Objectives must be set during the preparation for a
        workshop. As the workshop progresses, information is gathered, analysed and interpreted so that discussion can be
        effective and a decision reached as a result of an increased understanding of the issues involved.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing is integrated throughout the lifecycle.</strong> Because all stakeholders are present, this
        provides the quality control approach of testing ideas and deliverables as they are discussed. Participants have
        the opportunity to challenge or agree.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>A collaborative and co-operative approach between all stakeholders is essential.</strong> The facilitator
        is responsible for creating the climate of co-operation within the workshop and enforcing any ground rules for the
        group to behave effectively. This is only possible with the co-operation and commitment of all stakeholders. It is
        an effective way of achieving either compromise or consensus.
    </li>
</ul>

</h4>
<p>
    The list below gives suggestions for the types of workshop that could be run during a project. Some of them could be
    combined and become sessions within a longer workshop. Depending on the size and complexity of the problems being
    addressed, it may not be necessary to obtain answers and decisions through a formal workshop although workshop
    techniques could still be used in an interactive session. The duration of workshops varies from project to project.

                    Workshops should be run by skilled facilitators. They should be impartial to the issues under
                    discussion with no stake in the outcome. An ineffective facilitator can bias a workshop or at worst
                    lead to its failure. It is a highly skilled role requiring sensitivity, diplomacy, quick thinking and
                    highly developed communication skills. The role of the Facilitator is not one to be taken lightly. It
                    is a skilled job and is instrumental in ensuring a workshop is successful. One way to ensure an
                    effective facilitator is to use one who has been accredited by&#160;GlobalNF (<a href="http://www.globalfn.org/" target="_blank">www.globalfn.org</a>).

    The role of the Facilitator is to concentrate on the workshop process so that all participants have an equal
    opportunity to contribute. The main task of the Facilitator is to deal with all of the "people" aspects of the
    workshops by getting participants to work as a team. The Facilitator documents results and decisions on flip-charts,
    for example, that act as "group memory". The Facilitator does not contribute to the content of the workshop.
